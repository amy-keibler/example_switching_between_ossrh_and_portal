# Example Switching Between OSSRH and Portal

## Setup

In order to use this, you'll need to create a `settings.xml` file. You can copy [`settings-example.xml`][settings] as a
starting point and then fill in the credentials with your user token information generated on the [Central Portal][csc].

## Usage

```shell
mvn --settings settings.xml clean deploy -P release,<repository>
```

where `<repository>` is either `ossrh` or `portal`.

Note: Using the Nix DevShell will set the settings file via an environment variable, so passing it in manually should
not be required.
